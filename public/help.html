    This module enables the segmentation of a marked object from the input image, as well as the classification of either the entire image or the resulting segmented part of it.
    <br><br>
    <b>Steps to run the algorithm:</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    1. Select an image to be analyzed. 
    <br>
    <br>
    3. Mark the image with foreground and background annotations, using the foreground/background tooltip on the top-right.
<br>
<br> 
    4. Optionally, select which deep classifier to use, whether to segment the image, the segmentation quality and whether to classify the entire image or the segmented object instead.
<br>
<br>
    5. Press the 'Run' button. Analysis may take some time depending on the image and segmentation quality.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    6. Results are given in visual and table formats, depending on whether the segmentation and classification functionalities respectively were enabled in the options.
