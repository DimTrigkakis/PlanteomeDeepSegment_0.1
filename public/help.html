    This module segments a marked object (creating a graphical object) within an input image. Then the module will classify either the entire original image or the segment created in the first step. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Steps to run the algorithm:</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    1. Select an image to be analyzed.
    <br>
    <br>
    2. The foreground/background annotation tooltip can be found on the top-right of the module image viewer. Mark the part of the image to be segmented with foreground line(s) annotation(s). Mark the image with background annotations around the object to be segmented.
<br>
<br> 
    3. Optional: Select which deep classifier to use, whether to segment the image, the segmentation quality, and whether to classify the entire image or the segmented object instead.
<br>
<br>
    4. Press the 'Run' button. Analysis may take some time depending on the image and segmentation quality.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    5. Results are given in visual and table formats, depending on whether the segmentation and classification functionalities respectively were enabled in the options.
